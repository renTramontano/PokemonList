  PokemonAPI is a swift wrapper for PokÃ©API (pokeapi.co).
  Easily call web services to get info about Pokemon and the Pokemon games.
  The framework supports paginated responses, allowing you to quickly get the next results or a specific page.
  Linked resources can quickly be turned into their associated classes via a generic `fetch(_ resource:)` function.
  All code is Swift native with no third party frameworks.
